# Project Overview: Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## What did I need to install?
I needed an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

>I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

## Why this Project?
In this project, I will go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.<br />
I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What did I Learn?
* I know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* I am comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* I know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
* I now have experience communicating the results of my analysis
* I'am able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
* I'am familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently
* I know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings

# Project Details: How did I Complete this Project?
For the final project, I conducted my own data analysis and created a [jupyter file](https://github.com/beingjainparas/Udacity-Investigate_a_dataset/blob/master/Investigate_a_dataset-TMDb_movie_database.ipynb) and [html file](https://github.com/beingjainparas/Udacity-Investigate_a_dataset/blob/master/Investigate_a_dataset-TMDb_movie_database.html) which can be viewed over [here](https://beingjainparas.github.io/Udacity-Investigate_a_dataset/Investigate_a_dataset-TMDb_movie_database.html) to share my findings. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. I did not required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I made it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended.

## Project Details: Dataset
[TMDb movie data](https://github.com/beingjainparas/Udacity-Investigate_a_dataset/blob/master/Resources/tmdb-movies.csv) (cleaned from original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata))

## Project Details: Overview and Notes
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
* Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
* There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
* The final two columns ending with “adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

## Project Details:Example Questions
* Which genres are most popular from year to year?
* What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
