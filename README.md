# Project Overview: Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## What did I need to install?
I needed an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

## Why this Project?
In this project, I will go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What did I Learn?
* I know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* I am comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* I know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
* I now have experience communicating the results of my analysis
* I'am able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
* I'am familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently
* I know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
